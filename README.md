# Project: Developing a Sokoban-like Video Game with Phaser and BiteCS

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a **Sokoban-like** video game using an **ECS (Entity Component System)** architecture. We will be using **Phaser** (for the game rendering) and **BiteCS** (for managing the ECS architecture).

### Game Objective

The game you will create is a **Sokoban-like** game. The objective is to push blocks on a grid to reach an exit door, while following the typical Sokoban rules:
- You can only **push** blocks.
- A block can only be moved if the space in front of it is empty.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into **4 stages**, each representing a different phase of the gameâ€™s development. Each stage must be completed in sequence, and every stage improves upon the previous version of the project.

- **Stage 1**: Setting up the base structure using Phaser and BiteCS.
- **Stage 2**: Implementing player and block movement.
- **Stage 3**: Managing victory conditions (reaching the exit door).
- **Stage 4**: Adding challenges and improving gameplay.

### Using Git

Each stage of the project is available on a separate Git branch. You will need to switch to the appropriate branch for the stage you are working on.

### Switching to the Correct Git Branch

To work on a specific stage, you need to **clone the repository** and **switch to the correct branch**. Here is an example command to switch to the branch for stage 1:

```bash
git checkout step1-student
```

> Replace `step1-student` with the branch corresponding to the stage you are working on.

### Downloading the Branch as a ZIP File

If you prefer not to use Git to retrieve the branch, you can also **download the ZIP file** of the branch from GitHub. Select the correct branch from the repository page, then click on **Download ZIP**.

Follow these instructions for each stage of the project and ensure you are working on the correct branch for each phase of development.
